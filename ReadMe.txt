Game: Mancala

Rules:
1. Every cup starts with 4 marbles
2. When a cup is played the player will place one of the starting cups marbles in each consecutive cup until there are no marbles remaining in the starting cup.
3. When a player passes by their goal they place a marble in it. 
4. If they end their turn on their own goal they get another turn.

Capturing:
If a player places their last marble in one of their own cups which was empty, and the adjacent cup is not empty then they get both the marble that they just placed in 
and the marbles in the adjacent cup. 

End of Game:
The game ends when one of the players has no more marbles in any of their cups, and there for cannot play. When this happens the other player will take all the marbles 
that were left in their cup.
